1. Perform tokenization (Whitespace, Punctuation-based, Treebank, Tweet, MWE)
using NLTK library. Use porter stemmer and snowball stemmer for stemming. Use
any technique for lemmatization.
2. Perform bag-of-words approach (count occurrence, normalized count occurrence),
TF-IDF on data. Create embeddings using Word2Vec
3. Perform text cleaning, perform lemmatization (any method), remove stop words
(any method), label encoding. Create representations using TF-IDF. Save outputs.
4. Create a transformer from scratch using the Pytorch library
5. Perform different parsing techniques using Shallow parser, regex parser
6. A) Apply log linear model for sentiment analysis
B)Implement and extract Named Entity recognition techniques using given text:
&#39;&#39;&#39;Deepak Jasani, Head of retail research, HDFC Securities, said: “Investors will look
to the European Central Bank later Thursday for reassurance that surging prices are
just transitory, and not about to spiral out of control. In addition to the ECB policy
meeting, investors are awaiting a report later Thursday on US economic growth,
which is likely to show a cooling recovery, as well as weekly jobs data.”.&#39;&#39;&#39;

7.A) Implementing Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for topic modeling and
evaluate using the reconstruction error.
B) Implement Wordnet to show Word Disambiguition.

8.Perform word Embedding techniques on covid-19 dataset using FastText and Glove.
Save outputs.

9.A) Implement n-gram model.
B) Implement Latent Dirichilet Allocation model and Latent Semantic Analysis for
topic modelling using text: &#39;the quick brown fox&#39;,
       &#39;the slow brown dog&#39;,
       &#39;the quick red dog&#39;,
       &#39;the lazy yellow fox &#39;
       
10. Fine tune a pre-trained transformer for any of the following tasks on any relevant
dataset of your choice:  1. Neural Machine Translation  2. Classification 
